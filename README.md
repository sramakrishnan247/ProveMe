# ProveMe: A Theorem Prover for Propositional Logic
![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/sramakrishnan247/ProveMe/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

### About
This project proves sentences by [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)) refutation given an input Knowledge base.

### Requirements üîß
* Java version 8 or higher.

### Installation üîå
1. Press the **Fork** button (on the top right corner of the page) to save a copy of this project on your account.

2. Download the repository files (project) from the download section or clone this project by typing in the bash the following command:

       git clone https://github.com/sramakrishnan247/ProveMe
3. Import the project using Intellij Ide(or any other Ide or your favorite text editor)
4. Save your file in "./src/main/resources/your_file.txt";
5. Give your filename and run the application from Main.java :D

### Input format:
The input file starts with a line ‚ÄúKnowledge Base:‚Äù and then follows with sentences separated by blank lines. Once the KB is loaded, add the sentences that reads "Prove the following sentences by refutation:" followed by the sentences that need refutation. You can find sample input files in src/main/resources/.


### Sample run

### Input

```
Knowledge Base:

( Rain && Outside ) => Wet

( Warm && ~Rain ) => Pleasant

~Wet

Outside

Warm

Prove the following sentences by refutation:

Pleasant

Rain
```

### Output
```
KB expressions
( Rain && Outside ) => Wet
( Warm && ~Rain ) => Pleasant
~Wet
Outside
Warm

Sentences to be proved:
Pleasant
Rain
